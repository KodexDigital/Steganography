Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or physical object, making the hidden message undetectable to the naked eye or standard analysis tools. It's a way to hide the very existence of a communication, unlike cryptography, which scrambles the message content. Steganography can be applied to various types of digital media, including images, audio, video, and even network protocols.
